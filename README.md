### Technologies Used:
- **HTML:** Provides the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements for a visually appealing user interface.

### Features:
1. **User Input:** Users can input their name and their partner's name into designated input fields.
2. **Calculate Button:** Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the application generates a random love score and displays a corresponding message based on the calculated score.
